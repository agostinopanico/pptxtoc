Generate a ToC PowerPoint slide from an input PowerPoint file using a markup tag

To add something to the Table of Contents add something like this to the notes on a slide:

```
Please ignore this line; it is used for generating the Table of Contents: {{{This is the test to show in the ToC}}}
```

The text between the triple curly braces `{{{ }}}` will be added to the table of contents. The font face and style does not matter.
